# Memory Safety & Rust

This repository holds plans for a student-lead course to be offered in the Fall of 2016.
It will be embedded in CS 189: Programming Practicum as a group of students
working on a directed project.
It will be held during the 2nd half semester, and will likely take ~8 hours per
week.
